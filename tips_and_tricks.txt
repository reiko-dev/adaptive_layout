Before start developing make a design of your app on the smallest screen size and on the biggest one. After that you can start coding.

The scaffold is needed when we are using the complete screen. Like when we want to change the AppBar or use a full screen on differents places on the app.

Define breakpoints for your design, like: 
if(x)
    return WideLayout();
else
    return NarrowLayout();
